## Observations
- Summary: This is a technical paper exploring the use of machine learning, particularly deep learning, to solve complex optimisation problems in communications and signal processing. The paper starts by outlining the theoretical foundations of machine learning, focusing on deep neural networks, recurrent neural networks, echo-state networks, reinforcement learning, and federated learning. It then delves into the characteristics of 'hard' optimisation problems, those that pose difficulties for traditional numerical methods due to their complexity, randomness or dynamic nature. The paper argues that machine learning techniques are well-suited for tackling such problems and presents a range of illustrative applications, including wireless scheduling, power control, virtual reality, and vehicular communication. The authors conclude by outlining future research directions, advocating for further exploration of deep learning in emerging areas such as sensing at terahertz frequencies, underwater optical communications, and the integration of federated learning with distributed optimisation frameworks.
